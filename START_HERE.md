## 🔄 How It Works

**Simple Example: User submits a service request**

```
1. User fills form on frontend
   ↓
2. JavaScript collects data
   ↓
3. fetch() sends POST to backend API
   ↓
4. Backend validates input & JWT token
   ↓
5. Creates document in MongoDB
   ↓
6. Database returns confirmation
   ↓
7. Frontend receives success response
   ↓
8. Shows confirmation & refreshes dashboard
```

**Every step is documented with comments!**
